C lag comp

for dedicated cs2d servers on linux.

description:
rewrite of Lua Lag Comp (gist.github.com/854210) in C as a lua library.

usage:
1. use make to compile.
2. copy files to <cs2d folder>/sys/lua/.
3. get a 32-bit liblua.so. usually you can just install a package from your
   distro's repo. if not, you can compile from the source. contact me for help.
4. start cs2d_dedicated like:
	LD_PRELOAD=<path to liblua.so>/liblua.so <cs2d folder>/cs2d_dedicated
